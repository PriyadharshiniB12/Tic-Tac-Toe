#Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows two players to play the classic game on a 3x3 grid directly in their web browser. 
The game automatically detects winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), handles draws, and provides a button to restart the game once it's over.
Key Features:
Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns to place 'X' and 'O' on the grid.
Win Detection: The game checks for three consecutive 'X' or 'O' marks in rows, columns, or diagonals and automatically announces the winner.
Draw Detection: If all grid spaces are filled and no player has won, the game will detect and display a draw.
Restart Option: After a game ends, players can easily restart to play again without reloading the page.
Responsive Design: The interface is mobile-friendly, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
User Interface: The clean and minimalistic design ensures an intuitive and enjoyable user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: Provides the structure and layout for the game.
CSS3: Styles the game, ensuring itâ€™s visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, win/draw detection, player interaction, and restart functionality.
How It Works:
The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing 'X' or 'O' by clicking on the grid cells.
After each move, the game checks for a win (three in a row) or a draw (when the grid is full and no one has won).
When the game concludes, players can click the "Restart" button to reset the game and start a new round.
This project is a great exercise for learning how to build interactive web applications with basic front-end technologies. 
It is also a fun and simple game to share with others!
